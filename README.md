# Bluetooth App

This is a simple Bluetooth app that allows users to search for available Bluetooth devices, establish connections, and send files between their devices. The app is built using Vue.js, Node.js, and Express, and it utilizes the Web Bluetooth API to interact with Bluetooth devices.

## Getting Started
